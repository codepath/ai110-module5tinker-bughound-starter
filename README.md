# 🐶 BugHound

BugHound is a small, agent-style debugging tool. It analyzes a Python code snippet, proposes a fix, and runs basic reliability checks before deciding whether the fix is safe to apply automatically.

## What BugHound Does

Given a short Python snippet, BugHound:

1. **Analyzes** the code for potential issues  
   - Uses heuristics in offline mode  
   - Uses Gemini when API access is enabled  

2. **Proposes a fix**  
   - Either heuristic-based or LLM-generated  
   - Attempts minimal, behavior-preserving changes  

3. **Assesses risk**  
   - Scores the fix  
   - Flags high-risk changes  
   - Decides whether the fix should be auto-applied or reviewed by a human  

4. **Shows its work**  
   - Displays detected issues  
   - Shows a diff between original and fixed code  
   - Logs each agent step

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running in Offline (Heuristic) Mode

No API key required.

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Heuristic only (no API)

This mode uses simple pattern-based rules and is useful for testing the workflow without network access.

---

## Running with Gemini

### 1. Set up your API key

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Gemini (requires API key)
* Choose a Gemini model and temperature

BugHound will now use Gemini for analysis and fix generation, while still applying local reliability checks.

---

## Running Tests

Tests focus on **reliability logic** and **agent behavior**, not the UI.

```bash
pytest
```

You should see tests covering:

* Risk scoring and guardrails
* Heuristic fallbacks when LLM output is invalid
* End-to-end agent workflow shape
